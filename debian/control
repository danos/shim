Description: boot loader to chain-load signed boot loaders under Secure Boot
 This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows verifying
 signatures of other UEFI binaries against either the Secure Boot DB/DBX or
 against a built-in signature database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,
 infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA, while allowing
 an OS distributor to revision their main bootloader independently of the CA.
