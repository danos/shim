shim (15.4-5~deb10u1) buster; urgency=medium

  * Add defensive code around calls to db_get. Don't fail if they
    return errors.

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Sat, 08 May 2021 00:14:00 +0100

shim (15.4-4~deb10u1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix up those maintainer scripts - if we're not running on an EFI
    system then exit cleanly.

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Mon, 03 May 2021 21:31:33 +0100

shim (15.4-3~deb10u1) buster; urgency=medium

  * Add maintainer scripts to the template packages to manage
    installing and removing fbXXX.efi and mmXXX.efi when we
    install/remove the shim-helpers-$arch-signed packages.
    Closes: #966845

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Mon, 03 May 2021 21:31:33 +0100

shim (15.4-2~deb10u1) buster; urgency=medium

  * Add two further patches from upstream:
    + fix import_one_mok_state() after split
    + Don't call QueryVariableInfo() on EFI 1.10 machines (e.g. older
      Intel Mac machines)

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Wed, 21 Apr 2021 01:06:27 +0100

shim (15.4-1~deb10u1) buster; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release fixing more bugs: SBAT and arm64 support
  * Print sha256 checksums of the EFI binaries when the build is done
  * Add two patches from upstream:
    + fix i386 binary relocations
    + allocate MOK config table as BootServicesData

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Wed, 31 Mar 2021 19:56:02 +0100

shim (15.3-1~deb10u3) buster; urgency=medium

  * Only include the upstream version in the Debian SBAT metadata, so
    we don't break reproducibility on every minor packaging change.

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2021 13:31:51 +0000

shim (15.3-1~deb10u2) buster; urgency=medium

  * Add missing build-dep on xxd for build-time unit tests

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Wed, 24 Mar 2021 02:26:22 +0000

shim (15.3-1~deb10u1) buster; urgency=medium

  * Rebuild the new upstream version for buster
  * Switch to gcc-8 for building
  * Switch to much-newer release with many fixes
    + Particularly pulling in SBAT changes for better revocation support
    + Remove all our old patches, no longer needed:
      - avoid_null_vsprint.patch
      - check_null_sn_ln.patch
      - fixup_git.patch
      - uname.patch
      - use_compare_mem_gcc9.patch
    + Now includes a vendor copy of gnu-efi with quite a few extra
      fixes needed.
    + Update copyright file to cover these changes
  * Add dbx entries for all our existing grub binaries
    + They're insecure, let's break the chainloading hole.
  * Add Debian SBAT data
    + Add a Debian SBAT template, and rules to use it
    + Adds a build-dep on dos2unix

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Debian Janitor ]
  * Trim trailing whitespace.
  * Use secure copyright file specification URI.
  * debian/copyright: use spaces rather than tabs to start continuation
    lines.
  * Bump debhelper from old 11 to 12.
  * Set debhelper-compat version in Build-Depends.
  * Set upstream metadata fields: Bug-Database, Bug-Submit.
  * Update standards version to 4.4.1, no changes needed.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Trivial changes to generating the inbuilt dbx if we're using it.
  * Upload to pick up rotated Debian signing keys

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-9) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Steve McIntyre ]

  * In the -helpers-ARCH-signed packages, change the version
    dependency on shim-unsigned to be >= and not =. This will allow
    for installation to still work in the window while we wait for the
    template package to do its second trip through the
    archive. Closes: #955356

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Jul 2020 00:57:16 +0100

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Use --padding when calling pesign to generate hashes for the dbx
    list, as recommended by Peter Jones. No actual changes needed in
    our list of hashes at this point - they work out the same either
    way.
  * Switch to using gcc-9 for builds, tweaking a patch from upstream
    to fix a FTBFS. Closes: #925816
  * Update debhelper compat level to 11 for shim and the
    signing-template

 -- Steve McIntyre <93sam@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:51:10 +0000

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
  * debian/control: Update Vcs-* fields

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Backport needed crash fixes:
    + VLogError(): Avoid NULL pointer dereferences in (V)Sprint calls
    + Fix OBJ_create() to tolerate a NULL sn and ln
  * Build using gcc-7 to get better control of reproducibility during the
    lifetime of Buster.
  * Build in a dbx list to blacklist binaries that we know to not be
    secure. Build-depend on a new (bug-fixed) version of pesign to
    generate that list at build time, using a list of known bad hashes.
  * Initial list of known bad hashes is just my personal test binary.

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Add Provides: and Breaks: to shim-helpers-$arch-signed to fix
    clashes with the old shim-signed package for fbx64.efi.signed and
    mmx64.efi.signed. Closes: #924619

  [ Helmut Grohne ]
  * Fix FTCBFS: Set CROSS_COMPILE. (Closes: #922152)

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Ansgar Burchardt ]
  * Correct maintainer address in signing template

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Remove Rules-Requires-Root in the signing template. We manually install
    things owned by root. There might be better ways to do this, but this
    will do for now.

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * No-change sourceful upload to get rebuilds (and hence build logs) from
    the buildds. Hoping to get this version signed by Microsoft, so let's
    make our setup as clean as possible.

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Philipp Hahn ]
  * debian/rules: fixing permissions no longer required
  * debian/rules: Disable ephemeral key on Debian.
  * Rename binary package to 'shim-unsigned'
  * Add template for signing {mm,fb}$ARCH.efi. (Closes: #922228)

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * Override lintian error about template rules file.
  * Include /usr/share/dpkg/architecture.mk instead of shelling out.
  * Add uname.patch to avoid embedding the kernel architecture in the
    binary and to use a fixed string instead.

  [ Steve McIntyre ]
  * Change maintenance address to be the EFI team
  * Add me and vorlon to the Uploaders list
  * Rename the helper binary packages to shim-helpers-$arch.
  * Update the signing-template JSON metadata to match new practice:
    + Move all the data under a new top-level "packages" key
    + Add an empty "trusted_certs" key - the helper binaries do not do any
      further verification with an embedded key.

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update debian/watch.
  * Update VCS to point to salsa.
  * Fix debian/rules syntax for arm64 build.
  * Enable build for i386.
  * Ensure DEB_HOST_ARCH is set even if not present in the environment.
  * Update Standards-Version.
  * Update debian/copyright (drop reference to file no longer in source)

shim (15+1533136590.3beb971-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
    - debian/patches/second-stage-path: dropped; the default loader path now
      includes an arch suffix.
    - debian/patches/sbsigntool-no-pesign: dropped; no longer needed.
  * Drop remaining patches that were not being applied.
  * Sync packaging from Ubuntu:
    - debian/copyright: Update upstream source location.
    - debian/control: add a Build-Depends on libelf-dev.
    - Enable arm64 build.
    - debian/patches/fixup_git.patch: don't run git in clean; we're not
      really in a git tree.
    - debian/rules, debian/shim.install: use the upstream install target as
      intended, and move files to the target directory using dh_install.
    - define RELEASE and COMMIT_ID for the snapshot.
    - Set ENABLE_HTTPBOOT to enable the HTTP Boot feature.
    - Update dh_auto_build/dh_auto_clean/dh_auto_install for new upstream
      options: set MAKELEVEL.
    - Define an EFI_ARCH variable, and use that for paths to shim. This
      makes it possible to build a shim for other architectures than amd64.
    - Set EFIDIR=$distro for dh_auto_install; that will let files be installed
      in the "right" final directories, and makes boot.csv for us.
    - Set ENABLE_SHIM_CERT, to keep using ephemeral self-signed certs built
      at compile-time for MokManager and fallback.
    - Set ENABLE_SBSIGN, to use sbsign instead of pesign for signing fallback
      and MokManager.
